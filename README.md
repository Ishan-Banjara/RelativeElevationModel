# **Getting Started**
Relative Elevation Model (REM), a particular kind of digital elevation model (DEM), shows the terrain's height in relation to a baseline, usually a river's water surface. By detrending the baseline elevation to follow the water's surface, this technique facilitates the visualization of river characteristics and landscape changes. 

**Key Points about REMs:** 

- Visualization: River channels, meander scars, terraces, and oxbow lakes can all be visualized with the aid of REMs. 

- Applications: Helpful for engineering projects, habitat evaluations, flood studies, and channel migration analysis. 

- Methods: A number of techniques, such as cross-sectional approaches and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation, can be used to generate REMs.

In general, REMs are generated using QGIS, however, here REMs will be created using python packages, thanks to [DahnJ](https://github.com/DahnJ)

# **Download and Load DEM**
DEM is downloaded from [USGS Lidar Explorer Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/lidar-explorer/#/).

In this project, REM will be generated for [USGS 1 Arc Second n40w091 20220721](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/62da2f2fd34e2842e1ee190f), and visualization should incorporate **Mississippi River** and **Illinois River**
